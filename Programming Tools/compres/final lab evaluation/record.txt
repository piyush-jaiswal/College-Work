This paper has reviewed the automated # approaches for MS lesion segmentation, classifying them according to the # strategy used. In addition, the results obtained by these approaches have been summarised and compared, reviewing ! also the most common data sets and evaluation measures used in ! this field. We observed that the automated ! segmentation of ! different MS lesion types in MRI is a challenging task due to heterogeneous intensity values among the # different MR images.
